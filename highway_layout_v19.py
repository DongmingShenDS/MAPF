"""
v3: graph edge is unweighted 
    => highly possible to find path (2 direction) with overlapping edges
v4: graph with weighted edge design 
    => problem: edge cases where limiting edges does not resolve conflicts at intersection
    => simply removing edge/adding edge cost does not resolve node conflicts
v5: weighted & directed edge design
    => when creating the original graph, each undirected edge replaced by 2 directed opposite edge (conjugate)
    => when an edge is occupied by a hw, remove its conjugate => avoid actual conflict
    => when an edge is occupied by a hw, add cost c in [0, inf) => avoid too much traffic
    => in this way, each road can have at most 1 in/out in each direction, a max of 4 in/out
v6: add file output function
v7: add "lock" function
    set lock as L
v8: what "lock"s each "lock" can reach => lock reachability
    replace end of road with X
v9: try to fix previous "lock" two problems:
    1. lock not connected any town nodes => cannot reach from town
    2. lock disconnect town nodes => town become disconnected now
v10: refactor code & add documentation up to v9
v11: modifications on making the result T-connected
    - this makes the result more possible to be T-conncected when graph is square
    1. find outer highway endpoints
    2. try to make them connected clockwise, before layout other part of highways
    * this step can be done recursively, layer by layer, possible extension... *
    Definition of T-connected: 
        for each town1-town2 pair, there is a direct highway from town1 to town2, where: 
            adj 2 town nodes (within same town) are bi-direction connected 
            adj town node & lock node are bi-direction connected
            adj 2 lock nodes are NOT connected
            adj lock node & highway node are bi-direction connected
            adj 2 highway nodes are only connected based on highway direction
v12: build town classes, check town connectivity
v13: add more constraint on picking outer highway endpoints
    1. the end point picked is as close to the ideal as possible (max is max_search_around)
    2. the end point picked MUST be connected with 4 surrounding map nodes (except edges?)
    => result T-connected maps: 
        Boston_0_256 (0), ost003d (0), den312d (0)ï¼Œrandom-64-64-20 (0), den520d (1) 
v14: improve inner highway layout algorithm:
    1. try all adjacent (s, t), same as before 
    2. if not found path between (s, t), try: (s-, t) & (s, t+) until find both or run out of s- & t+  
v15: output update for lock_reachability => no more json, now locks.txt
v16: highway connection output => rl_edges.txt
    - previous: from previous versions, highways.txt does not show direction at interaction
    - update: rl_edges.txt contains the direction of outputs for each highway node (4 dir binary)
v17: output for visualization => vis_gmap.json 
v18: fix ideal_end_pts problem (top right corner)
    - can't simply switch between floor & ceiling, example: (7.3 will have one 7 one 8)
    - fixed by using a double to store the summation, then always cast (trim) to int
v19: fix some bugs in a1v1
