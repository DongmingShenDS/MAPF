# MAPF-MARL

This repository contains Dongming Shen's demonstration code and documentation for the research projects conducted at the IDM Lab, USC. The project focuses on integrating Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to explore efficient coordination strategies among autonomous agents in dynamic environments.

NOTE: code are for demo-purpose only, not readily available to be used, as some sensitive parts are hidden.
